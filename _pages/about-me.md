I am a [research software engineer at King's College London](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/nadine-spychala) within a newly established [central research software engineering (RSE) team] (https://docs.er.kcl.ac.uk/research_software_engineering/), and aim to write software that is more reproducible, shareable and allows to more easily build upon existing research incrementally. For me, being an RSE means to contribute to a larger project – that of improving science. I am also a final-stage doctoral researcher in computational neuroscience/complex systems at the [Sussex Centre for Consciousness Science](https://www.sussex.ac.uk/research/centres/sussex-centre-for-consciousness-science/), University of Sussex, where I validate information-theoretic measures of complexity and emergence in both simulated data to inform empirical applications.

In this context, I worked on a [Python library](https://openlifesci.org/posts/2022/03/17/ols-4-participant-nadine-spychala/) to easily apply and compare different measures on different data, in an understandable and comprehensive way including documentation & tutorials. This work has also been part of my mentorship within the [Open Life Science mentoring & training program for Open Science ambassadors](https://openlifesci.org/) where I have been a mentor myself. I've been a 2023/2024 [Software Sustainability Institute](https://www.software.ac.uk/) (SSI) Fellow aiming to send a strong signal for SSI’s slogan “better software, better research” by providing software development workshops to research communities I’m involved in myself. Feel free to check out (and re-use) material for an [intermediate research software enginnering tutorial in Python](https://hackmd.io/@nadinespy/rkteKiVDn) that I've created for the Artificial Life conference 2023 in the context of my fellowship.

I aim to work on impactful causes, and have therefore recently leveraged my expertise in complexity science/emergence research for AI safety within a [PIBBSS (Principles of Intelligent Behaviour in Biological and Synthetic Systems)](https://pibbss.ai/) fellowship. See a talk on my research project [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAzncDxGUxs).

I have been the main organizer of a symposium on computational approaches to the mind: [Rethinking Computational Approaches to the Mind - Fundamental Challenges & Future Perspectives](https://computationalmind.github.io/). Recorded talks and panel discussion can be viewed on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoIPNxWj9puhD9kCjnvOEWdY_jVPhcWJu).

I've participated in many [Brainhacks](https://brainhack.org/), and have also been teaching extensively throughout my academic career so far, most notably in data science and machine learning, including supervising master thesis work, and philosophy.

My academic work so far has been strongly interdisciplinary, intersecting mathematics, machine learning, neuroscience, as well as philosophy. Before starting my doctoral work, I have been investigating information integration in variational inference ([still doing so](https://github.com/nadinespy/IntegratedInformationInVariationalInference)), and looking at embodiment processes in an [EEG-based BCI study](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00461/full). I have strong interests in metascience, philosophy of science, moral philosophy, as well as AI safety. 

Besides science, I have also been working as a data analyst in medical education research, teaching assistant for German for refugees, and psychologist for unaccompanied refugee minors. I like volunteering (and have done that most recently at [GrowNYC](https://www.grownyc.org/), an environmental sustainability organization in New York).  

I do photography and share my work on my [photo blog](https://continuousminds.wordpress.com/) (disctontinued - new work will be posted elsewhere) as well as on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/continuousminds/). I also post about (ultra mountain) running & music/culture in the UK/around the world in [another account](https://www.instagram.com/nads.py/).
