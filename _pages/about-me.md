I am a doctoral researcher in computational neuroscience at the University of Sussex where I validate information-theoretic measures of complexity and emergence in both simulated and empirical data. In this context, I also work on a [Python library](https://openlifesci.org/posts/2022/03/17/ols-4-participant-nadine-spychala/) to easily apply and compare different measures on different data, in an understandable and comprehensive way including documentation & tutorials. This work has also been part of my mentorship within the [Open Life Science mentoring & training program for Open Science ambassadors](https://openlifesci.org/). I value open & reproducible research that is aligned with ethical research culture & incentives, and do my best to comply to best practices.

I like [Brainhacks](https://brainhack.org/), and I like teaching & supervision (currently in machine learning).

My academic work so far has been strongly interdisciplinary, intersecting mathematics, machine learning, neuroscience, as well as philosophy. Before starting my doctoral work, I have been investigating information integration in variational inference ([still doing so](https://github.com/nadinespy/IntegratedInformationInVariationalInference)), and looking at embodiment processes in an [EEG-based BCI study](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00461/full). 

Besides science, I have also been working as a data analyst in medical education research, teaching assistant for German for refugees, and psychologist for unaccompanied refugee minors. I like volunteering (and have done that most recently at [GrowNYC](https://www.grownyc.org/), an environmental sustainability organization in New York).
