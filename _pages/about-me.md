I am a doctoral researcher in computational neuroscience at the University of Sussex where I validate information-theoretic measures of complexity and emergence in both simulated and empirical data. In this context, I also work on a [Python library](https://openlifesci.org/posts/2022/03/17/ols-4-participant-nadine-spychala/) to easily apply and compare different measures on different data, in an understandable and comprehensive way including documentation & tutorials. This work has also been part of my mentorship within the Open Life Science mentoring & training program for Open Science ambassadors. I generally value open & reproducible research that is aligned with ethical research culture & incentives, and do my best to comply to best practices.

I am enthusiastic about Brainhacks, and like teaching (currently in machine learning).

My academic work so far has been strongly interdisciplinary, intersecting mathematics, machine learning, neuroscience, as well as philosophy. Before starting my doctoral work, I have been investigating information integration in variational inference (still doing so), and looking at embodiment processes in an [EEG-based BCI study](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00461/full). 

Besides science, I have also been working as a data analyst in medical education research, teaching assistant for German for refugees, and psychologist for unaccompanied refugee minors. I like volunteering (most recently in environmental sustainability at GrowNYC, New York).
